     * and updates lifecycles of the existing components to match the new state.
     *
     * The navigation is usually performed synchronously, which means that by the time
     * the `navigate` method returns, the navigation is finished and all component lifecycles are
     * moved into required states.
     *
     * Should be called on the main thread.
